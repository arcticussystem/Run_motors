# Run_motors
Simple C-code to run two DC-motors with a RPi and a L298N (Motordriver).
The code will change the speed of each motor with one PWM signal and the direction with two digital outputs (0 || 1). 

The purpouse with this code is to demonstrate how to use the wiringPi library to drive multiple motors with PWM and to change the direction of the motors.
